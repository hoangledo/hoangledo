# Hi, I'm Hoang 👋

🎓 Computer Science @ University of Rochester  
💻 Software Engineer Intern @ Meta (Summer 2025)  
🏆 5× Hackathon Winner | Builder at heart  

I love building things — especially turning ideas into working products, learning fast, and figuring things out along the way.  
Most of what I know comes from shipping, breaking, fixing, and repeating.

## 🧠 What I’m Actively Learning & Following

I stay up to date with modern engineering by constantly exploring how real systems are built and scaled.

- AI & applied ML in real products  
- AI Agents, RAG pipelines, and MCP-style workflows  
- Fintech systems and data-driven decision making  
- Backend architecture and system design  
- Cloud infrastructure, DevOps, and CI/CD pipelines  
- Developer workflows, tooling, and automation  

I enjoy picking up new technologies quickly — especially when they help me build better, faster, or more reliable systems.

## 🌱 How I Learn

I learn best by building:
- prototype first  
- read docs second  
- iterate fast  
- understand deeply  

Curiosity, consistency, and shipping matter more to me than knowing everything upfront.
